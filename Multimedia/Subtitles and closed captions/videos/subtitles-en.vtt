00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.690
Okay. Now, this is week
number 1 of the course.

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.820
In week number 1,
we'll talk about

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.490
different hardware components
for a computer system.

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.419
There are many
different components

5
00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:13.890
within a computer system.

6
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.320
We have different applications

7
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.425
installed on an operating system,

8
00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:22.620
which has different
device drivers

9
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.425
to drive different
hardware components.

10
00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.450
In general we say that how we are

11
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.120
components are the physical,

12
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.945
tangible pieces that we can

13
00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:34.140
actually see and touch
of a computer system.

14
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.525
So what can computers do?

15
00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:38.190
In summary, we say that

16
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.275
computers can
acquire information,

17
00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:41.655
store information,

18
00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:44.835
manipulate information
and share information.

19
00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:47.160
Computers can do them quickly,

20
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.840
reliably, cheaply,
and also tirelessly.

21
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.540
That's why we can categorize

22
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.045
hardware components into
four different types;

23
00:00:56.045 --> 00:01:01.260
for acquiring information,
storing information,

24
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.435
processing information, and
also sharing information.

25
00:01:06.435 --> 00:01:09.515
For input devices, we
have, for example,

26
00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:12.970
keyboard and mouse for input.

27
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.910
For output devices, we have,

28
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.110
for example, printer
and monitor for output.

29
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.120
For processing, we
have CPU and also GPU.

30
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.700
For storage, if you talk about

31
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.635
volatile storage, we have RAM.

32
00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:32.025
If we're talking about
permanent storage,

33
00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.590
we have, for example,

34
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.185
SD card and also hard disc
for permanent storage.

35
00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:40.280
In this module we will talk

36
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.260
about all these
hardware components.
